## large compressed expression matrices are available at the following links:
These transcriptome expression level matrices are from the 39 studies contained in the metaGxBreast Bioconductor data package.  Samples are in rows and genes are in columns.
### matrices with no between-study normalization
Combine the first archive with one of two following archives to form a complete set
- [mGXnoNorm.tar.xz](https://snet-bio-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example15bmc/mGXnoNorm.tar.xz): 31 transcriptome expression level matrices from metaGxBreast package with no additional normalization
- [mGXnoNormNoBatch.tar.xz](https://snet-bio-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example15bmc/mGXnoNormNoBatch.tar.xz): 8 expression matrices containing unseparated sample batches with no additional normalization
- [mGXnoNormBatch.tar.xz](https://snet-bio-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example15bmc/mGXnoNormBatch.tar.xz): 25 expression matrices generated by splitting the 8 matrices above by batch, with no additional normalization
